# Customer-Analysis-Business-Insights

Sales (retail) data of transactions from December 2009-December 2011. I use this two year data to generate business insights. Firstly, basic EDA is performed to answer questions like:

Does there exist seasonality in the quantity sold?
What are the top selling products in each country and overall, and the customers that generate the most revenue for the business?
Which products are frequently returned by customers and thus should be improved?
Finally, I perform customer segmentation to study how the business is performing in terms of customer loyalty and retainment. I use RFM measures to label each customer; those labels are then aggregated to see how the overall business is performing. These labels could also be used to devise clever advertising/marketing strategies specific to a group of customers.

Also, based on RFM, K means clustering is performed and the optimal number of clusters is found using elbow curve and Davies Bouldin index. These clusters are further studied using mean values of recency, frequency, and the revenue generated.
